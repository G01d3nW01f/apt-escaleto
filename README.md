# apt-escaleto

this script is for local privilege escalations,
however this is easy test version. so perhaps not really works to useful.
but test was succes on my environments:)

python script but, if target machines not installed python, then you need execute commands direct.

infact this script is only executing the OS commands
just like a trash or somethings
